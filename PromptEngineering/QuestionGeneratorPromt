Context: [Provide a detailed context in which the answer to the original question is embedded.]

Original Question: [Insert the original question here.]

Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the provided context to understand where and how the answer to the original question is presented.
2. Your task is to rephrase the original question in a manner that would lead to effective embedding-based searches.
3. Consider the following points while rephrasing:
   a. Ensure the rephrased question is concise and clear.
   b. Focus on using keywords and terms that are likely to yield accurate embeddings.
   c. Adapt the question to a more general form if needed, to increase search relevance.
   d. Aim for a question that would generate informative and contextually relevant search results.
4. Your rephrased question should capture the essence of the original question while being better suited for embeddings-based searches.
