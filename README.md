### ROUGE Score For Model Evaluation

ROUGE-N (ROUGE-Ngram): Measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated text and the reference text. ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap), ROUGE-2 (bigram overlap), and ROUGE-3 (trigram overlap) are common variants.

ROUGE-L (ROUGE-Longest Common Subsequence): Measures the longest common subsequence between the generated text and the reference text. It captures long-range dependencies and order of words.

ROUGE-W (ROUGE-Weighted): Similar to ROUGE-N, but assigns different weights to different n-grams based on their importance.

ROUGE-S (ROUGE Skip-Bigram): Measures the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are pairs of words that have at most k intervening words. ROUGE-S4 is a common variant.
